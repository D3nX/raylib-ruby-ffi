# raylib Ruby (FFI)
<h1>Ruby (FFI) bindings for raylib</h1>

Hello there !<br />
Here is the official (FFI) bindings of raylib for the Ruby programming language !<br />
Made with Ruby [FFI](https://github.com/ffi/ffi), which is a clever and excellent lib for call C from Ruby<br /><br />

**WARNING**<br />
The binding is absolutely not finished and the code is not clean yet. Though you can actually try some examples and play with the library =)<br />
<br />
Enjoy :3
